# Udaciflashcards

Udaciflashcards is the final assessment project for Udacity's React course. It is a flashcards app, which users can use to study sets of flashcards. Users are able to create sets of flashcards called 'decks'. They are then able to add flashcards to these decks and take quizzes on the decks.

This is an IOS app. Currently there isn't support for Android.
